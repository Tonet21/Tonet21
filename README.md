ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Antoni LlinÃ s BarbarÃ . 

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in AI. During my bachelor's in Barcelona (UAB), I studied philosophy, and there, I developed an interest in **XAI**, the **ethics of AI**, and **semantics**.
With those interests, I moved to Italy to study for my Master's in Cognitive Science, focusing on **computational linguistics** and **NLP**. I'm particularly interested in LLMs and multimodal models. I think we need these models to be more ethical and transparent and I  would love to help on that some day.
I'm constantly expanding my knowledge in this field by taking online courses on data science (SQL), MLOps, prompting, fine-tuning, and more. 
 

âš¡ Fun fact: I have two surnames because I'm from Spain, but my mother tongue is not Spanish; it's Catalan.
