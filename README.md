ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Antoni LlinÃ s BarbarÃ . 

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in AI. During my bachelor's in Barcelona (UAB), I studied philosophy, and there, I developed an interest in **XAI**, the **ethics of AI**, and **semantics**.
With those interests, I moved to Italy to study for my Master's in Cognitive Science, with a special focus on **computational linguistics** and **NLP**.

âš¡ Fun fact: I have two surnames because I'm from Spain, but my mother tongue is not Spanish; it's Catalan.
